    <h1>Yedi Technologies Inc. - Written Assignment</h1>
    <p>Thank you for applying for the Full Stack Software Engineer position at Yedi Technologies Inc.</p>

    <h2>Engineering Values</h2>
    <ul>
      <li><strong>Speed with Discipline:</strong> We are a startup, so we <em>have</em> to move fast, but that doesn't
        mean we can afford to be sloppy with our practices.</li>
      <li><strong>Quality over Quantity:</strong> We like to be intentional and focused about why and how we build
        things. As such, we need to make sure what we ship is reliable and scalable.</li>
      <li><strong>Transparency:</strong> We seek and tell the truth, even where those truths are painful or
        inconvenient.</li>
      <li><strong>Ownership and Autonomy:</strong> As a mostly remote company, we can't constantly monitor how each of
        us works. We want people who are self-driven and proactive about their work.</li>
      <li><strong>Problem-Solving Mindset:</strong> We want people who like to challenge themselves to solve new
        problems. Sometimes this also means sharing ideas and collaborating on solutions!</li>
      <li><strong>Balanced Scalability:</strong> We are building with thousands, soon millions, of daily users in mind.
        We need to build robust systems that accommodate our operational and financial circumstances as a startup.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Instructions:</h2>
    <ol>
      <li>Submit a written response (in PDF format) addressing the following question:</li>
      <blockquote>
        <p>These values are not always in harmony with each other. Tell us about a time in your career or education
          where you had to balance between two of these values and how you handled it. (Max word count: 500)</p>
      </blockquote>
      <li>If you use generative AI tools, please include both the prompt and the answers generated.</li>
      <li>Send your response to <a href="mailto:applications@yedi.app">applications@yedi.app</a>.</li>
    </ol>
    <p class="deadline"><strong>Deadline:</strong> Please submit your response by January 12 2025.</p>
    <p>If your submission meets our expectations, we will invite you to proceed to the next round of our interview
      process.</p>
